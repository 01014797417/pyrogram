# How to Contribute

There are multiple ways you can help grow this project. Two easiest way:

* [Reporting Bugs](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
* [Feature Request](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram/issues/new?labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md)

Please read the checklist before creating either of them.

Another way is to look at [issues](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram/issues) to see if any open issues
could use some help. If you are interested in a ticket, post a comment and ask if you can work on that ticket.
If the ticket gets assigned to you, or you get a üëç. Next fork the project, create a branch and start
coding. When done you can create a pull request [here](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram/compare).
